	<h2> </h2>
	<p>	I am karan, I hail from Tamil Nadu a southern state in India and I was born and brought up in Villupuram. I started my schooling in Ramakrishna Vidyalaya. <br><br>


	After my schooling due to my interest in Computer science , I opted to choose engineering study for my bachelors.  <br><br>

	I completed my bachelor degree of engineering in electronics and communication from Vels University, Chennai. During my engineering study apart from my curricular activities I used my innovative ideas to learn new things. <br> <br>

	After completing my bachelor degree, I took a time to explore the available opportunities and chose the appropriate field to pursue my career. <br><br> Meanwhile to keep my logical thinking sharp I decided to take banking exams as it provided my career opportunities too. With my logical thinking, I am more interested in programming and I have decided to pursue my career as a programmer.
